# Investigate-A-Dataset-Titanic-Data
As part of Udacity's Data Analysis Nano Degree (DAND), I had a project to investigate a data set. This includes cleaning the data programmatically, adding new features, imputing missing data points, and creating some basic visualizations to communicate the findings. All using Python, basically Pandas and Numpy.
